Here, I present a curated selection of assignments and projects from two courses: 
**Interactive Computing** and **Web Development**. The portfolio spans a diverse range of creations, including immersive experiences in **VR** and **AR**, as well as engaging 2D games, crafted using **JavaScript** with p5.js and A-frame p5 library.

*Some images were sourced online / offered by the instructor to enhance the visual effect.*
