          <h3> Description </h3>
          <br>

          Twin Adventure is my Midterm Project for the Fall 2022 Interactive Computing class written using p5.<br><br>

          This is a three-level tile-based game implemented on two canvases. The story is about twin sisters finding each other with their quirky telepathy, aka mirroring. This is made possible by having one sister on each canvas and using global variables to move them around simultaneously mirroring each other. <br><br>

          The ultimate goal for twin sisters is to get to the exits in the middle down below, diagonal to their own starting spots, before the life value runs out. On the left canvas, there are rocks that block the sister’s way; on the right canvas, there are gnomes who bring down the sister’s life value upon contact. All the rocks, gnomes, hearts etc. live in arrays and OOP is utilized to bring all of them to life. 
          <br><br> 

          As a tile-based game, its world is made from 11 x 11 global matrices (nested arrays). The world is presented visually by the javascript file reading the id in each position in the matrices (e.g. if col 2 row 2 is 1, show a tree here). By having sensors around her, the sister can detect the id of the tile she’s moving toward and react responsively. <br><br>

          There are three levels of this game: <br><br>

          <ul>

            <li>Level 1 - Random maps. Random maps are generated every time level 1 begins. This is also the only level the sisters can increase their life value by collecting hearts.</li>
            <li>Level 2 - Random popup. Stones and gnomes pop up and disappear at a certain frequency. </li>
            <li>Level 3 - Random wandering. Gnomes move around randomly and disappear at a certain frequency. </li>
            
          </ul>

          If any of the three levels fail, you can choose to replay the game or wait to be brought back to the main menu in 7 seconds. If the sisters passed all three levels, you win and will be automatically brought back to the menu. <br><br>

          There are three difficulty levels of the game, which can be picked from the initial interface. The difficulty level is stored in the local storage, which remains unchanged until a new difficulty level is picked. The different level of difficulty is mainly reflected in the popup frequency in level 2 and the gnomes’ wandering speed in level 3. <br><br>


          Short music will be played when the game is over or win. All of the artwork and sound effects are from online open source, such as OpenGame Art. <br><br>

          The  <a href="../ownMap/index.html"> customized map feature</a> is explored yet not implemented in the current game consdering the complexity, but can be built into future versions. <br><br>

          Thank you for reading this looong description & playing my quirky game (*¯︶¯*).
